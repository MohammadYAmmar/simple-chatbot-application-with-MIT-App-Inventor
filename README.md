The design interface and what was used, I used a play button, a place to show the text, a static image of the program logo, and an image that appears at the end.A clock sensor was also used to improve time after speech by adding a delay function>

Block used as code for the program to run it, we notice that I have used two functions, one to run the program and analyze speech and response based on what was heard, and another function for delay so that after hearing the speech a window of speech with the application appears,And the delay function takes milliseconds, so every 1000 milliseconds means one second, so the application delays 5 seconds.
